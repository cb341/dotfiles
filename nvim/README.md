# 💤 LazyVim

I used to use my own nvim distro a while back, with custom bindings, plugin configurations and such
but I decided to try out a distro after a while

here is lazyvim, because i like the plugin manager and ithas god documentation.
most features work out of the box and the ones that annoy me i can just remove.

managing language servers has been a nightmare and i am happy lazyvim takes care of it.

here is alzyvim with some more vim specifics, like recudec animations, classic surround and stuff like oilvsnetrw/nerdtree, no markdown rendering, performance improvmeents


as well as some unorthodfox things like multicursor
